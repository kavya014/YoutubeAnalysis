A new attribute named as 'category_name' was added by retrieving the associated category name for the category ID of all
data instances, from the JSON files.
The datasets contained in seperate files were merged into one dataframe with the addition of a new attribute, named as 'region'. 

Data of all attributes was of the type : string.
The following changes were done -
1. All numeric columns (Category ID,Views,Likes,Dislikes,Comment Count ) was
transformed into type : int.
2. Trending Date column was transformed into datetime format.
3. Publish Time column (consisting of both publish date and publish time) was
divided into 2 columns : Publish Date and Publish Time , in the datetime format.

The newly formed dataframe was transferred into a .csv file named 'YouTubeData.csv' , for further analysis in the course work.
